  "about": {
    "intro": "A rustic wedding in Italy is a celebration of authentic Italian countryside—where centuries-old masserie welcome guests with their thick stone walls and terracotta roofs, where ceremonies unfold among ancient olive groves, and where receptions honor regional traditions with farm-to-table cuisine and local wines. Italy's rustic venues are treasures of tradition, many dating back centuries as fortified farmhouses or agricultural estates.",
    "philosophy": "Rustic Italian weddings embrace natural beauty and authentic charm. Think terracotta tiles, weathered stone, wildflower bouquets, long wooden tables under pergolas, and the genuine warmth of Italian hospitality. It's elegance without pretense—sophisticated simplicity rooted in the land.",
    "serviceStandards": "Rustic venues in Italy typically feature: centuries-old stone architecture (masserie, farmhouses, trulli), extensive grounds with olive groves, orchards, or vineyards, indoor and outdoor dining spaces with terracotta floors, courtyards and outdoor pergolas for ceremonies, authentic regional design with local materials, working agricultural elements (olive presses, wine cellars), and natural settings that celebrate the Italian countryside.",
    "investment": "Rustic weddings in Italy typically range from €40,000 to €180,000 for 60–150 guests, offering excellent value. Puglian masserie command €50,000–€150,000, while Tuscan farmhouses offer options from €40,000–€120,000. Rustic venues provide authentic charm and farm-to-table cuisine at a more accessible price point than luxury or seaside venues."
