  "about": {
    "intro": "A villa wedding in Italy is the quintessential Italian romance—where stone archways frame sunset ceremonies, Renaissance frescoes adorn intimate dining halls, and fragrant gardens bloom with lavender and roses. Italy's villas are living monuments to Italian elegance, many dating back to the 15th and 16th centuries, when wealthy families commissioned architects to design their summer retreats and country estates.",
    "philosophy": "Italian villa weddings celebrate understated sophistication and authentic charm. Think garden parties with citrus trees, al fresco dinners under pergolas, twilight ceremonies in courtyards, and receptions in frescoed halls. It's refined without pretense—timeless elegance that feels like home.",
    "serviceStandards": "Villa venues in Italy typically feature: extensive gardens with ancient olive groves and formal parterres, multiple outdoor ceremony and reception spaces, frescoed or vaulted indoor halls for dining, panoramic views (hillsides, lakes, or coastlines), pool areas for daytime relaxation, terraced areas for alfresco dining, and authentic Italian architecture with stone, terracotta, and weathered wood.",
    "investment": "Villa weddings in Italy typically range from €60,000 to €300,000+ for 80–200 guests, depending on location, exclusivity, and season. Famous Lake Como villas command €150,000–€400,000+, while Tuscan hillside villas offer excellent value at €60,000–€180,000. Peak season (May–June, September) requires booking 12–18 months in advance."
