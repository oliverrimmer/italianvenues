    "intro": "A luxury wedding in Italy is the pinnacle of refined celebration—where centuries-old estates meet modern five-star service, Michelin-starred chefs create bespoke menus, and every detail is curated to perfection. Italy's luxury venues aren't just beautiful; they're destinations with pedigree, often former homes of nobility, artists, or titans of industry, now transformed into exclusive sanctuaries for the world's most discerning couples.",
    "philosophy": "Luxury in Italy transcends material opulence. It's about authenticity, heritage, and artisanship: hand-painted frescoes by Renaissance masters, gardens designed by baroque architects, wine cellars stocked with vintages from the estate's own vineyards, and service so personalized that your sommelier remembers your preferred vintage. Italian luxury is understated elegance with soul.",
    "serviceStandards": "Italy's luxury wedding venues typically offer: exclusive use (full property buyout), dedicated wedding coordinators, Michelin-level or Michelin-starred catering, world-class spas and wellness facilities, helicopter landing pads, private art collections, sommelier services, and bespoke experiences like private opera performances, yacht charters, or after-hours museum tours.",
    "investment": "Luxury weddings in Italy typically range from €200,000 to €1,000,000+ for 100–150 guests, depending on the venue, season, and level of customization. This includes exclusive use, multi-day celebrations, Michelin dining, premium florals, entertainment, and concierge services. Many couples host 3-day weekend celebrations with welcome dinners, ceremonies, and farewell brunches."
