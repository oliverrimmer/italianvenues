  "about": {
    "intro": "A seaside wedding in Italy is pure Mediterranean magic—where the scent of salt air mixes with lemon groves, where terraced ceremonies overlook turquoise waters, and where sunset receptions unfold to the sound of gentle waves. Italy's coastlines offer some of the world's most dramatic wedding settings: the UNESCO cliffs of the Amalfi Coast, the refined Tyrrhenian shores of Tuscany, and the volcanic island paradises of Ischia and Capri.",
    "philosophy": "Italian seaside weddings embrace la dolce vita coastal style—effortless elegance, fresh flavors, and natural beauty. Think barefoot luxury: linen suits, bougainvillea cascades, seafood feasts, and golden hour photographs with the Mediterranean as your backdrop. It's sophisticated yet relaxed, glamorous yet authentic.",
    "serviceStandards": "Seaside venues in Italy typically feature: outdoor terraces or gardens overlooking the sea, direct beach access (private or public), fresh seafood-focused menus, Mediterranean gardens with olive and lemon trees, infinity pools, boat arrival options, and spectacular sunset views. Many offer both ceremony and reception spaces at the water's edge.",
    "investment": "Italian coastal weddings typically range from €80,000 to €400,000+ for 80–150 guests, depending on location, season, and venue exclusivity. Amalfi Coast venues command premium prices (€150,000–€400,000+), while Tuscan coast and island properties offer value (€80,000–€200,000). Coastal venues shine from May through October, with September offering the perfect balance of weather and value."
