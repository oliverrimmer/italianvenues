  "heroDescription": "Perched seventy meters above the Mediterranean, this legendary boutique hotel cascades down Positano's most coveted clifftop—where Michelin-starred dining, hand-painted majolica tiles, and terraces framing endless blue horizons create the Amalfi Coast's most iconic celebration setting.",
  "intro": "There's a moment when you first step onto Le Sirenuse's sea-facing terrace—past the lemon trees and bougainvillea, beyond the famous pool—when Positano reveals itself in full glory below and the Mediterranean stretches to infinity. That view has captivated guests since 1951, when the aristocratic Sersale family opened their summer villa as a hotel and accidentally created an icon. Today, Le Sirenuse remains family-run and feels exactly like what it is: an impossibly elegant private home that happens to welcome the world's most discerning travelers. The hand-painted tiles tell stories, the antiques have provenance, the staff remember your name, and dinner at Michelin-starred La Sponda unfolds by the light of four hundred candles flickering against frescoed walls. For weddings, this means exchanging vows on terraces where the sunset turns the sea to gold, dancing in spaces that blend classic Italian grandeur with effortless sophistication, and giving your guests an experience they'll recount for decades.",
  "history": {
    "description": "The Sersale family's Positano villa had been their private summer escape for generations—an 18th-century palazzo clinging to the cliffside where family gathered each summer to swim, dine on the terraces, and watch the sun set over the Mediterranean. It was paradise, but paradise with just one family enjoying it.",
    "loveStory": "In 1951, the family made the decision to share their beloved home with the world. Rather than simply opening a hotel, they created something that retained the soul of a private residence—furnishing rooms with family antiques, commissioning local artisans to create hand-painted majolica tiles throughout, maintaining gardens and terraces exactly as they'd always been kept. Guests arrived not as customers but as friends invited into an extraordinary home.",
    "inauguration": "Over seven decades, Le Sirenuse has expanded thoughtfully—adding rooms, creating the Michelin-starred La Sponda, building the iconic pool, developing partnerships with private beach clubs—but never losing that sense of being welcomed into the family's world. Today, three generations later, the Sersales still personally oversee every detail. It's that continuity of vision and genuine warmth that makes Le Sirenuse feel different from every other luxury hotel—and what makes celebrations here feel like you've been given the keys to the most beautiful home on the Amalfi Coast."
