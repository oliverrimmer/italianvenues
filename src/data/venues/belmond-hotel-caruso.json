  "heroDescription": "An 11th-century palace floating 350 meters above the Mediterranean, where terraced gardens cascade toward the sea, an infinity pool seems carved from the sky itself, and every celebration unfolds against views that stretch from Salerno to Capri.",
  "intro": "Ravello sits above the Amalfi Coast like a secret the cliffs decided to keep—higher, quieter, more ethereal than the villages hugging the shoreline below. And at Ravello's crown sits Belmond Hotel Caruso, an 11th-century palazzo where history and luxury have merged so seamlessly you stop noticing which century you're standing in. Walk through frescoed halls where noble families once entertained, step onto terraces where the Mediterranean appears to start at your feet, discover the infinity pool that's become one of the world's most photographed—not through Instagram fame but because that view genuinely stops your breath. The Wagner Gardens spill down the hillside in a riot of Mediterranean flora, creating ceremony spaces where the backdrop needs no decoration beyond what nature and architecture already provide. With fifty rooms ensuring intimate scale, Belmond service setting the standard for Italian hospitality, and exclusive use transforming the entire property into your private cliff-top kingdom, Caruso delivers the Amalfi Coast wedding at its most refined.",
  "history": {
    "description": "The palazzo's foundations were laid in the 11th century, when Ravello flourished as a wealthy maritime republic. Noble families built their residences at this elevated position—high enough to see approaching ships, close enough to the sky to feel removed from earthly concerns. For centuries, the building served as a private palace, its halls echoing with the conversations of aristocrats, artists, and thinkers drawn to Ravello's otherworldly beauty.",
    "loveStory": "The transformation into a hotel began in the early 20th century, but it wasn't until Belmond's meticulous restoration that Caruso reached its current perfection. Every fresco was carefully preserved, every garden terrace rebuilt to period specifications, every modern luxury incorporated without compromising the historic soul. The infinity pool—now the hotel's icon—was designed to appear as though it had always existed at precisely this point where earth meets sky.",
    "inauguration": "Today, Belmond Hotel Caruso represents the ideal balance: genuine 11th-century architecture housing contemporary five-star luxury. The frescoes are real, the antiques authentic, the views unchanged since medieval times. But the comfort, service, and attention to detail reflect modern perfection. It's this combination that makes celebrations here feel both timeless and utterly present."
