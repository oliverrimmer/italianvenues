  "heroDescription": "A Renaissance villa commanding 2,000 acres of UNESCO-protected Val d'Orcia countryside, where world-renowned Italian gardens cascade down hillsides and every view frames the landscape that inspired centuries of painters and poets.",
  "intro": "Drive the white gravel roads of Val d'Orcia long enough and you'll find yourself climbing toward Villa La Foce, a 15th-century estate perched where the views stretch forever across rolling hills, cypress alleys, and those perfectly imperfect farmhouses dotting golden fields. The villa itself tells a quieter story than some Tuscan palaces—elegant rather than grandiose, refined rather than showy—but step into Cecil Pinsent's legendary gardens and you understand why this place has captivated everyone from writers to royalty. Terraces spill down the hillside in geometric precision, roses climb ancient walls, and the pergola frames ceremonies like a Renaissance painting come to life. With 2,000 acres ensuring absolute privacy, multiple historic buildings accommodating large groups, and spaces ranging from intimate gardens to a grand gallery seating 220, La Foce offers something rare: authentic Tuscan nobility without pretension.",
  "history": {
    "description": "Villa La Foce's foundations were laid in the late 1400s, when this strategic position overlooking Val d'Orcia made it both a working estate and a place of beauty. For centuries it remained exactly that—a noble family's countryside retreat where life followed the rhythms of harvest and season.",
    "loveStory": "The villa's romantic transformation came in the 20th century through Antonio and Iris Origo, whose devotion to each other and to this land created something extraordinary. Iris, a celebrated writer, chronicled their life here in books that captured the soul of rural Tuscany. Antonio, with English landscape architect Cecil Pinsent, reimagined the gardens into the masterwork that exists today—formal Italian design flowing seamlessly into the wild Tuscan countryside.",
    "inauguration": "Pinsent's gardens became legendary, drawing admirers from around the world who came to see how perfectly proportioned terraces, geometric box hedges, and carefully placed statuary could feel both classical and alive. Today, Villa La Foce remains in the Origo family, opened to celebrations that honor the estate's legacy of beauty, culture, and the belief that great spaces should be lived in, not just preserved."
