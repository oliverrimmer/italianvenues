  "heroDescription": "A 17th-century Dominican monastery transformed into the Amalfi Coast's most intimate luxury retreat, where just twenty rooms cascade down the cliffside through tiered gardens, an otherworldly infinity pool floats above the Mediterranean, and Michelin-starred dining unfolds in spaces where sisters once gathered in prayer.",
  "intro": "Some places on the Amalfi Coast announce themselves—grand hotels visible from every angle, bustling with energy and guests. Monastero Santa Rosa does the opposite. Tucked into the cliffs of tiny Conca dei Marini, accessible only by a narrow coastal road, this former 17th-century monastery reveals itself slowly. First come the gardens—four terraced levels descending the precipice, planted with the herbs and flowers Dominican sisters once cultivated. Then the infinity pool materializes, seeming to levitate over the Gulf of Salerno in a way that defies both physics and reason. Finally, you discover the monastery itself, beautifully restored to honor its contemplative past while embracing contemporary luxury. With just twenty rooms ensuring genuine intimacy, Il Refettorio's Michelin-starred cuisine served in the former refectory, and an atmosphere that still carries echoes of the peace those cloistered sisters sought, Monastero Santa Rosa creates weddings unlike anywhere else—smaller by design, quieter by nature, and somehow both sacred and sensual in ways that larger venues can never replicate.",
  "history": {
    "description": "In the 1600s, Dominican sisters chose this dramatic clifftop for their monastery—seeking isolation, contemplation, and perhaps that view which even then must have felt like looking directly into heaven. For centuries they lived here in prayer and work, cultivating gardens on the terraced hillside, tending to the sick, and maintaining rhythms unchanged by the world beyond these walls.",
    "loveStory": "When the monastery closed in the early 1900s, the buildings slowly succumbed to time and weather—walls crumbling, gardens reverting to wild. The bones remained beautiful, but it took visionaries to see what this place could become. The restoration preserved every authentic element: vaulted ceilings and stone floors, the former chapel with its sacred geometry, corridors designed for contemplation, garden terraces following their original layout. But into this historic shell came modern luxury—that impossible infinity pool, a world-class spa, rooms that balance monastic simplicity with sensual comfort.",
    "inauguration": "Today, Monastero Santa Rosa stands as proof that transformation doesn't require abandoning history. The peaceful atmosphere those sisters created still permeates every corner. You feel it walking the garden paths, dining in the former refectory, watching sunset from the pool. This isn't a monastery turned party venue—it's a sacred space that's learned to celebrate love without losing its soul."

    "description": "Exclusive use of Monastero Santa Rosa transforms this cliffside sanctuary into your private coastal refuge. All twenty rooms become yours, accommodating up to forty overnight guests in spaces that honor the building's contemplative past while delivering modern luxury. Your intimate celebration—because this venue simply won't accommodate crowds, and that's precisely its magic—flows between the Convivio Terrace (where thirty-five seated guests means genuine intimacy), the terraced gardens (where ceremonies feel suspended between earth and sky), the infinity pool (where cocktail hours become sublime), and Il Refettorio (where Michelin-starred cuisine is served in a space designed centuries ago for communal meals). The monastery's scale creates natural closeness—guests don't get lost in distant rooms or overwhelmed by numbers. Instead, they experience what the Dominican sisters understood: that beauty, peace, and celebration are amplified when shared in deliberate, human-scaled spaces. The dedicated team orchestrates every detail while preserving that sense of tranquil escape.",
    "transfers": "Private transfers from Naples Airport (1.5 hours) along the dramatic coastal road. The monastery's shuttle service provides transport to Amalfi (10 minutes) for guests wanting to explore. Boat arrivals at Amalfi followed by short drives offer another atmospheric option."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "q": "What is the maximum wedding capacity?",
      "a": "Monastero Santa Rosa is intentionally intimate—the Convivio Terrace accommodates 35 guests for seated dinners, and garden spaces can host up to 60 for ceremonies or cocktail receptions. This isn't a limitation but the venue's defining feature: celebrations here are smaller by design, creating the kind of genuine closeness larger venues can't replicate."
    },
    {
      "q": "How many guests can stay at the monastery?",
      "a": "The twenty rooms and suites accommodate approximately forty overnight guests. For celebrations of this size, having everyone stay on property creates a multi-day house party atmosphere—breakfast together in the morning, spa treatments throughout the day, dinners that stretch late into evening."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is exclusive use required?",
      "a": "For weddings, yes—exclusive use ensures the intimate, private atmosphere that defines the Monastero Santa Rosa experience. This isn't just a policy but a philosophy: the monastery was built for contemplation and community, qualities that require genuine privacy to maintain."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does the restaurant have a Michelin star?",
      "a": "Yes, Il Refettorio holds one Michelin star. The restaurant operates in the monastery's original refectory—where sisters once shared simple meals in silence, world-class Italian cuisine is now served with views that somehow make exceptional food taste even better."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can we have a ceremony in the chapel?",
      "a": "The former chapel is available for symbolic ceremonies. While it's no longer consecrated for religious services, the space retains its sacred atmosphere—centuries of prayer have created an energy that's palpable. Many couples find this offers something unique: a ceremony space designed for devotion, without the constraints of official religious requirements."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is the famous infinity pool available for events?",
      "a": "Absolutely. The pool terrace accommodates up to forty guests for cocktails and smaller ceremonies. Sunset hours there are particularly magical—that moment when the pool seems to catch fire with reflected light and the entire Gulf of Salerno turns gold."
    },
    {
      "q": "What if we want a larger wedding?",
      "a": "Then Monastero Santa Rosa probably isn't your venue—and that's okay. This monastery was built for a small community of sisters who chose contemplative intimacy over scale. Today it creates the same experience for celebrations: smaller numbers, deeper connections, more meaningful presence. If you're planning for hundreds, other spectacular Amalfi Coast venues can accommodate you. If you're planning for your closest forty people, nowhere else captures this particular magic."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do we reach Conca dei Marini?",
      "a": "Conca dei Marini sits between Amalfi and Positano on the coastal road—ten minutes from either. The monastery arranges transfers from Naples Airport (1.5 hours) and operates a shuttle to Amalfi for guest convenience. The relative remoteness is part of the appeal: you're on the famous Amalfi Coast but in a quieter, more secluded corner of it."
