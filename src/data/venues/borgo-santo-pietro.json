  "heroDescription": "A 13th-century villa transformed into a Relais & Châteaux sanctuary, where 300 acres of organic gardens, Michelin-starred dining, and holistic wellness create an extraordinary backdrop for intimate celebrations in the heart of Tuscany.",
  "intro": "Deep in the Val di Merse, where medieval villages cling to hilltops and cypress-lined roads wind through untouched countryside, Borgo Santo Pietro spreads across 300 acres of organic farmland like a private Tuscan kingdom. This isn't just a luxury hotel—it's a working estate where vines climb ancient walls, herbs perfume the air from terraced gardens, and your wedding unfolds across rose-filled cloisters, lakeside islands, and candlelit orangeries. A Michelin star in the dining room, a world-class spa drawing from the estate's own botanicals, and just 22 exquisite rooms ensure your celebration feels exclusive, intimate, and utterly removed from the everyday world.",
  "history": {
    "description": "The bones of Borgo Santo Pietro date back to the 13th century, when this medieval villa served the farming communities of the Val di Merse. For hundreds of years it stood witness to the rhythms of Tuscan rural life—harvests and festivals, saints' days and family celebrations.",
    "loveStory": "The current owners discovered the property in a state of romantic ruin and devoted themselves to a painstaking restoration that honors every original detail. Artisan craftsmen revived ancient frescoes, local stone masons rebuilt crumbling walls, and master gardeners coaxed life back into the terraced gardens. They didn't just restore a building—they brought a whole Tuscan world back to life.",
    "inauguration": "Today, Borgo Santo Pietro stands as a Relais & Châteaux property that somehow feels entirely undiscovered. The 300-acre estate operates as it would have centuries ago—an organic farm, vineyard, and garden—while offering the kind of refined luxury that earns Michelin stars and fills wedding albums with images that look like oil paintings come to life."
