  "intro": "A striking Roman villa and former mansion of Jean Paul Getty, La Posta Vecchia blends history and natural beauty. Overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea and Odescalchi Castle, it is an unforgettable venue for weddings, celebrations, and private occasions. Rich in history, the property has been home to Roman emperors, the noble Orsini family, and Jean Paul Getty, who filled it with Italian art treasures. Today guests are welcomed with 17th-century tapestries, marble busts of Roman emperors, and a rare antiquarian map by Giovanni Battista Piranesi.",
  "history": {
    "description": "La Posta Vecchia stands as an intriguing witness to Italian history. Once a seaside resort favoured by Roman emperors, later a Renaissance villa for the noble Orsini family, and finally the home of Jean Paul Getty, the billionaire who filled it with Italian art treasures. It was this extraordinary fusion of history and opulence that Roberto Sciò found irresistible, leading him to transform it into his family home.",
    "artCollection": "The interiors showcase a magnificent collection curated by Getty and his art historian Federico Zeri. A glorious 17th-century tapestry, dignified marble busts of Roman emperors Flavio Vespasiano and Agrippa, and an antiquarian map by Giovanni Battista Piranesi offer just a taste of the magnificent furnishings that adorn every wall and room."
