  "intro": "Perched above a private bay on Ischia, Mezzatorre Hotel & Thermal Spa occupies a historic 16th century watchtower. Today, it blends heritage, nature, and wellness — an exceptional hideaway proudly overlooking the Gulf of Naples, offering an intimate escape with thermal spa facilities and stunning Mediterranean views.",
  "history": {
    "description": "The structure that houses Mezzatorre Hotel & Thermal Spa has a fascinating history. It was, in fact, an ancient watchtower built between the 16th and 17th century by the Aragonese, which however was never finished (fittingly the name 'Mezzatorre' translates as 'Half-Tower'). It was enlarged in the 18th century by the dukes of Rancidello.",
    "modernEra": "In the 1930s, the tower was used as a pension until Luigi Patalano, a distinguished scholar, politician and poet, bought it. Founder of political and cultural magazines, he transformed the property into an active cultural cenacle. In the same park as Mezzatorre Patalano also built 'La Colombaia', a beautiful villa that was first owned by Baron Fassini, an aristocrat and bon viveur, and then, in the 50s, by film director Luchino Visconti. In 2018, the Sciò family came across Mezzatorre, fell in love with it and in 2019, the Pellicano Hotels Group took over its management. Marie-Louise Sciò, CEO & Creative Director of the Group, injected her very own personality into every corner of the property — and transformed it into an exceptional Italian abode that fits right into the Pellicano world."
