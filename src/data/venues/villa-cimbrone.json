  "heroDescription": "An 11th-century villa transformed into an open-air museum, where six hectares of UNESCO-protected gardens lead to the legendary Terrazza dell'Infinito—a marble-balustraded terrace floating 365 meters above the Mediterranean that's become the single most photographed viewpoint on the Amalfi Coast.",
  "intro": "Walk through Ravello's medieval streets until they narrow to a footpath climbing toward Villa Cimbrone, and you're following in the steps of everyone from Wagner to Virginia Woolf to Gore Vidal—all drawn by rumors of the villa's extraordinary beauty. Then you reach the gardens and understand the pilgrimage. Six hectares of terraced paradise unfold across the clifftop—classical temples hidden among roses, marble sculptures emerging from cypress groves, walkways winding past lemon trees and wisteria toward that moment when you round the final corner and discover the Terrazza dell'Infinito. Eighteen marble busts line the terrace's edge, and beyond them: nothing. Just infinite blue where sea and sky merge 365 meters below. The villa itself—dating to the 11th century but reimagined by Lord Grimthorpe in the early 1900s—mixes Gothic arches, Renaissance details, and Moorish influences into something that shouldn't work but creates pure romance. With nineteen rooms ensuring intimate scale, event spaces ranging from the dramatic crypt to elegant halls to those legendary gardens, and Ravello's elevated serenity setting the tone, Villa Cimbrone offers celebrations that feel suspended between earth and heaven.",
  "history": {
    "description": "Villa Cimbrone's story begins in the 11th century as a noble residence perched at Ravello's highest point. For centuries it remained relatively modest—a family villa with terraced gardens taking advantage of that commanding position. The views were always there, the location always spectacular, but it took an Englishman's obsession to unlock the full potential.",
    "loveStory": "In the early 1900s, British peer Lord Grimthorpe purchased the property and devoted years to its transformation. He didn't simply restore—he reimagined, adding Gothic arches and Moorish touches, creating the crypt, extending gardens across every available terrace, commissioning those eighteen marble busts that now define the Infinity Terrace. Grimthorpe collected art and architectural elements from across Italy, incorporating them into a villa that became part museum, part palazzo, part fantasy. He understood that the gardens should be experienced as a journey, each turn revealing new perspectives on the infinite blue beyond.",
    "inauguration": "Today, Villa Cimbrone stands as Lord Grimthorpe's enduring gift—a UNESCO World Heritage Site that draws visitors from around the world yet remains intimate enough for private celebration. The villa operates as a boutique hotel, ensuring that those extraordinary gardens and viewpoints can be experienced not just as day-trippers but as overnight guests who watch sunrise from the Infinity Terrace and discover corners of the property that feel entirely undiscovered."

Eighteen marble busts line the terrace's edge, each one framing a different slice of that impossible view—the Gulf of Salerno spreading to the horizon, the Amalfi Coast curving away in both directions, distant mountains floating in haze.

The two-night minimum for weekend buyouts allows proper celebration: welcome dinner Friday evening as guests explore the gardens at sunset, ceremony Saturday on the Terrazza dell'Infinito (where that view provides the only decoration needed), reception dinner in the Gothic Events Hall or under stars in the gardens, late-night dancing in the atmospheric Crypt, and Sunday recovery where your closest friends have the pool and property to themselves. Six hectares of gardens mean your celebration never feels crowded—guests discover hidden temples, stumble upon perfect photo opportunities, and experience the property as Lord Grimthorpe intended: as a journey of continuous discovery.

The property's multiple spaces allow celebrations to flow naturally between indoor elegance and outdoor magnificence."

    {
      "q": "How many guests can stay at Villa Cimbrone?",
      "a": "The nineteen rooms and suites accommodate approximately 38-45 overnight guests depending on configurations. For larger wedding parties, nearby Ravello hotels provide additional luxury accommodation."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is exclusive use required?",
      "a": "Yes, for Friday and Saturday weddings, exclusive use is mandatory (two-night minimum booking all nineteen rooms). This ensures complete privacy and allows your celebration to unfold across the entire property without restriction. Weekday events may have more flexible arrangements."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can we have our ceremony at the famous Infinity Terrace?",
      "a": "Absolutely—and most couples do. The Terrazza dell'Infinito accommodates up to 150 guests for ceremonies, though even larger groups feel intimate when everyone's facing those views. It's the single most requested ceremony location on the Amalfi Coast for good reason."
    },

      "q": "What about the UNESCO World Heritage status?",
      "a": "Villa Cimbrone's gardens are protected as part of the Amalfi Coast's UNESCO World Heritage designation, recognizing their historical and cultural significance.

For your wedding, it means celebrating in spaces of genuine world importance."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can we celebrate late into the evening?",
      "a": "With exclusive use, celebrations can continue until 1am—generous for a clifftop location where sound travels. The Crypt in particular offers an atmospheric late-night venue where music and dancing feel natural rather than disruptive."

    {
      "q": "How do guests reach Villa Cimbrone?",
      "a": "Ravello sits 365 meters above sea level, reached by winding roads from Amalfi (15 minutes). Once in Ravello, the villa is a scenic 10-minute walk from the town center along a pedestrian path—cars can't access the property. This creates natural anticipation: guests walk through medieval Ravello, following signs toward the villa, until suddenly those gardens appear. Luggage and mobility-impaired guests can be accommodated via service access."
    },
    {
      "q": "What makes Villa Cimbrone special compared to other Amalfi venues?",
      "a": "It's the combination of elements: genuine 11th-century origins, Lord Grimthorpe's architectural fantasy, six hectares of UNESCO gardens, that legendary Infinity Terrace, Ravello's elevated serenity, and intimate scale (just nineteen rooms). Other venues may have one or two of these qualities—Villa Cimbrone has them all. It's an open-air museum that happens to host the world's most beautiful weddings."
