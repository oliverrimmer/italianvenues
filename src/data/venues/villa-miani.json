  "heroDescription": "Perched atop Monte Mario—Rome's highest point—this 1837 neoclassical villa commands the city's most spectacular panorama, where St. Peter's dome rises in the foreground, the entire Eternal City spreads below, and 3,000 square meters of grand halls, terraced gardens, and that legendary view create Rome's ultimate celebration setting for gatherings from fifty to five hundred.",
  "intro": "There's a moment during every Villa Miani celebration when guests step onto the panoramic terrace and realize they're seeing all of Rome from above—St. Peter's dome so close you could reach out and touch it, the Tiber snaking through ancient quarters, landmarks emerging from terracotta rooftops like pieces of history refusing to be buried. Villa Miani sits atop Monte Mario, Rome's highest hill, commanding views no other venue can match. Built in 1837 for the aristocratic Counts Miani as their neoclassical retreat above the city's heat and crowds, the villa has evolved into Rome's premier large-scale event venue while maintaining that sense of noble grandeur. The numbers tell part of the story: over 3,000 square meters of event space, the Salone delle Feste accommodating 550 for seated dinners, multiple connected halls for simultaneous events, terraces hosting 500 for alfresco celebrations, capacity expanding to 1,800 with garden tents when occasions demand true scale. But statistics don't capture walking through marble halls where frescoes and chandeliers create natural elegance, or discovering the villa sits within private parkland ensuring complete seclusion despite being fifteen minutes from the Vatican, or that particular Roman sunset when the entire city glows golden and your celebration unfolds with the Eternal City itself providing the backdrop. With just a bridal suite for overnight stays (this is an event venue, not hotel), exclusive use ensuring privacy, Michelin-rated catering partners, and service refined across nearly two centuries of hosting Rome's most important gatherings, Villa Miani delivers the Roman wedding at its most panoramic and grand.",
  "history": {
    "description": "In 1837, the Counts Miani chose Rome's highest point for their villa—not just for views (though those were extraordinary) but for escape. Monte Mario sat high enough above the city to catch breezes that made summer bearable, distant enough from urban chaos to feel removed, yet close enough for the family to maintain their position in Roman society. They commissioned a neoclassical palazzo that captured the era's ideals: symmetry, proportion, elegance without excess.",
    "loveStory": "For generations, Villa Miani remained the family's private retreat—a place for summer gatherings, intimate dinners, celebrations that mixed nobility with Rome's artistic and intellectual elite. The villa witnessed the transition from papal Rome to Italian capital, from horse carriages to automobiles, from candlelight to electricity. Through all these changes, the Miani family maintained the property's essential character: a place designed for gathering, for celebration, for moments that required beauty and space.",
    "inauguration": "The transformation into an event venue happened as Rome modernized and the family realized these magnificent spaces shouldn't sit empty. Better to share them with couples and organizations whose celebrations could honor the villa's legacy. Today, Villa Miani operates under careful preservation standards, ensuring every event respects the neoclassical architecture while the experienced team delivers contemporary luxury. The views remain unchanged—that same panorama the Counts Miani enjoyed nearly two centuries ago, now backdrop to weddings, galas, and gatherings that continue the villa's tradition of hosting Rome's most important celebrations."

Accommodates 500 for alfresco dinners when weather cooperates, or serves as cocktail space before moving inside.

The 3,000-square-meter villa allows natural flow: ceremonies on the terrace as sunset paints the city gold, cocktails in the gardens as guests discover different perspectives on the panorama, reception in the Salone delle Feste where marble and frescoes create timeless elegance, after-party in connected halls where celebration continues until 1am. The dedicated team—experienced in events from intimate weddings to diplomatic galas—orchestrates everything while Michelin-rated catering partners ensure cuisine matches the setting's grandeur.

    {
      "q": "What makes the Villa Miani view so special?",
      "a": "Villa Miani sits atop Monte Mario, Rome's highest point, commanding unobstructed panorama across the entire Eternal City. St. Peter's dome rises so close in the foreground it feels touchable, with all of Rome spread beyond—the Tiber, every landmark, neighborhoods cascading down the famous seven hills. This isn't partial glimpse but comprehensive cityscape impossible from any other venue. That view becomes constant backdrop to your entire celebration."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the maximum wedding capacity?",
      "a": "The Salone delle Feste accommodates 550 for seated dinners. The panoramic terrace hosts 500 for alfresco events. With multiple halls used simultaneously, total indoor capacity reaches over 1,000. Garden areas with tents can expand to 1,800 for truly substantial celebrations. The villa scales beautifully from intimate gatherings to grand affairs."

      "q": "Can guests stay overnight at Villa Miani?",
      "a": "The villa offers one bridal suite and occasionally additional VIP rooms—total overnight capacity 4-6 guests maximum. This isn't a hotel but an event venue with limited accommodation for the couple and immediate family. Most wedding parties stay in Rome's hotels, with the fifteen-minute proximity making logistics effortless."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is exclusive use required?",
      "a": "Yes, Villa Miani books exclusively for weddings and events. This ensures complete privacy across all 3,000+ square meters of space, allows your celebration to flow freely between indoor and outdoor areas, and honors the villa's character as a private estate rather than commercial venue."
    },
    {
      "q": "What about weather backup?",
      "a": "With over 3,000 square meters of indoor space across multiple grand halls, weather concerns become opportunities rather than problems. Your terrace ceremony moves to the Salone delle Feste or another elegant hall, your alfresco dinner relocates indoors to spaces designed specifically for grand celebrations. The scale and quality of indoor options mean backup plans feel like preferred choices rather than compromises."
    },
    {
      "q": "How far is Villa Miani from central Rome?",
      "a": "Just fifteen minutes from the Vatican and twenty minutes from the Spanish Steps—close enough for easy guest logistics, far enough to feel elevated and removed. The position atop Monte Mario creates that perfect balance: Rome's convenience with mountaintop serenity and views."

      "a": "Villa Miani partners with Relais Le Jardin, a Michelin-rated caterer, ensuring cuisine matches the venue's standards.

    },
    {
      "q": "Why choose Villa Miani over other Roman venues?",
      "a": "It's the convergence of factors: that commanding panorama impossible from any other location, genuine neoclassical architecture from 1837, capacity ranging from intimate to truly grand (50 to 1,800), 3,000 square meters allowing celebration flow and flexibility, fifteen minutes from central Rome yet feeling completely removed, Michelin-rated catering, and service experience handling everything from intimate weddings to diplomatic galas. Other venues might excel in one area—Villa Miani delivers comprehensively while offering views that define Roman grandeur."
