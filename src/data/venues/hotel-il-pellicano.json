  "heroDescription": "Overlooking the cliffs of Monte Argentario, Hotel Il Pellicano is a legendary Tuscan retreat. A timeless destination for world-class dining and unforgettable celebrations on the Tyrrhenian coast.",
  "intro": "Overlooking the cliffs of Monte Argentario, Hotel Il Pellicano is a legendary Tuscan retreat founded in the 1960s by aviator Michael Graham and socialite Patsy Daszel. Originally a private club for friends and jet-set guests, today it offers timeless Italian charm, Michelin-starred dining, and unforgettable celebrations on the Tyrrhenian coast.",
  "history": {
    "description": "Il Pellicano was the result of a love story between Michael Graham, a British Royal Air Force (RAF) aviator and the only survivor of a plane crash in Africa in the mid-1950s, and Patsy Daszel, socialite of the American jet set, who cut out an article about the plane crash and pasted it in her diary with the hope that someday she would meet the charming British soldier.",
    "loveStory": "Like a fairy tale, her wish came true. Patsy and Michael met during a party in Pelican Point in California, and it was love at first sight. After travelling extensively around the world, the couple arrived in Tuscany, on the Monte Argentario peninsula, where they discovered this corner of heaven, reminiscent of the location of their first encounter. In this stretch of cliffs overlooking the sea, with the magnificent nature of Monte Argentario as the only background, Michael and Patsy decided to build Hotel Il Pellicano.",
    "inauguration": "They inaugurated the property in 1965 as a private club, where they could host friends, feel at home and fully embrace La Dolce Vita. Through the decades, Il Pellicano has continued to maintain that same embracing atmosphere, offering a unique 'Pellicano Experience' to anyone who stays or passes by – and creating a perfect setting for an extraordinary event."
