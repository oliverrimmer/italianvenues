  "heroDescription": "Rising from the hills above Florence, Castello di Vincigliata captures the romance of medieval Tuscany. This authentic 11th-century fortress offers sweeping views across the city and countryside, where ancient stone walls and terraced gardens create an unforgettable backdrop for your celebration.",
  "intro": "Perched above Fiesole with Florence spread below like a Renaissance painting, Castello di Vincigliata embodies everything couples dream of when imagining an Italian castle wedding. Built in 1031 and lovingly restored in the 1800s, the fortress has evolved from defensive stronghold to one of Tuscany's most sought-after celebration venues. Stone courtyards catch the golden afternoon light, terraced gardens cascade down the hillside through ancient olive groves, and every terrace frames a postcard view of the Duomo and Tuscan hills beyond.",
  "history": {
    "description": "The castle's story begins nearly a thousand years ago with the noble Visdomini family, passing through generations of Tuscan aristocracy—the Cattani da Diacceto, the influential Alessandri—each adding their chapter to these ancient walls. For centuries it stood as both fortress and family seat, witnessing the Renaissance unfold in Florence below.",
    "loveStory": "Legend speaks of Bianca, whose romantic tale has echoed through the castle for generations. These stone walls have sheltered countless love stories across the centuries, and that history makes every wedding here feel like joining an unbroken tradition of celebration and devotion.",
    "inauguration": "By the 1800s, Vincigliata had fallen to romantic ruin—until British expatriate John Temple-Leader discovered it and devoted years to its restoration. He reimagined the castle in a feudal style that captured the soul of medieval Tuscany while creating spaces grand enough for modern celebration. Today, Temple-Leader's vision lives on as couples from around the world choose Vincigliata for that rare combination of authentic history and breathtaking beauty."
