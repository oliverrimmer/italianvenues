  "heroDescription": "A 15th-century fortress rising from private parkland within Rome's city limits—where medieval watchtowers, frescoed banquet halls, a glass-roofed Winter Garden, and the particular romance of celebrating in a castle still inhabited by the noble family who've owned it for centuries create Rome's most dramatic wedding setting.",
  "intro": "Most couples planning Roman weddings face a choice: ancient ruins that can't be touched, or modern venues lacking soul. Castello di Tor Crescenza offers a third option—a genuine medieval castle just fifteen minutes from the Spanish Steps, surrounded by private parkland, still inhabited by the aristocratic family who've owned it since the 1400s, and available for exclusive celebrations that honor both its history and your vision. The castle rises from its grounds with medieval authority—towers built atop an 11th-century watchtower, grand halls added as the Crescenzi family's power grew, frescoes commissioned when Renaissance art flourished, and those courtyards and terraces that seem designed specifically for gathering and celebration. Today, the castle operates as Rome's premier event venue while remaining a protected historic monument and private residence. The scale accommodates both intimate gatherings and substantial celebrations: the Fireplace Room for sixty seated in frescoed intimacy, grand banquet halls for 250 beneath vaulted ceilings, the Winter Garden's glass roof sheltering 300 regardless of weather, courtyards for outdoor ceremonies, a private chapel for religious vows, and parkland exploration between events. With just six rooms for overnight guests (the castle isn't a hotel but a residence that welcomes celebrations), most guests stay in Rome's extraordinary hotels and gather at Tor Crescenza for one unforgettable day. The convenience of being within the city yet feeling entirely removed—medieval walls blocking traffic sounds, parkland creating buffer from urban energy—makes this uniquely Roman: history and convenience, grandeur and accessibility, all within twenty minutes of the Colosseum.",
  "history": {
    "description": "In the early 1400s, Marquis Francesco Crescenzi chose this strategic position just outside Rome's northern gates for his castle. The site already held an 11th-century watchtower—defensive remnant from when this area marked civilization's edge. Crescenzi built upon those medieval foundations, adding the towers, halls, and fortifications that established the castle's current form. As Rome expanded and the Crescenzi family's influence grew, successive generations refined interiors, commissioned frescoes, added courtyards and gardens.",
    "loveStory": "What makes Tor Crescenza extraordinary is continuity: the same noble family has inhabited these walls for six centuries. This isn't a castle converted to museum or hotel—it remains a private residence where the family lives, maintaining traditions of hospitality and celebration that stretch back through generations. When you celebrate here, you're guests in someone's home—albeit a home with medieval towers, frescoed halls, and the kind of architectural drama only centuries of aristocratic ownership creates.",
    "inauguration": "The transition to hosting events happened organically—the family realized these spaces designed for noble celebrations shouldn't sit empty. Better to share them with couples whose own important moments could honor the castle's legacy. Today, Castello di Tor Crescenza operates under strict heritage protection, ensuring every event respects the building's significance while the family ensures celebrations maintain the warmth and authenticity of genuine hospitality rather than commercial transactions."

Your celebration flows between spaces designed across centuries for exactly this purpose: ceremonies of 250 in the castle courtyards (where ancient walls and fountains create natural drama), receptions for 300 in the Winter Garden (where glass roof means weather never dictates plans), intimate dinners for 100 in the Fireplace Room (where frescoes and genuine medieval architecture create atmosphere modern venues cannot replicate), or grand banquets for 250 in the interconnected halls beneath vaulted ceilings the Crescenzi family commissioned when their power peaked. Between events, guests explore the parkland, discover hidden corners of the castle, photograph themselves against medieval towers, and experience what it means to celebrate in a fortress still inhabited by the noble family who built it. The six guest rooms accommodate your closest family overnight, though most guests stay in Rome's hotels and shuttle to the castle—creating that perfect balance of urban vitality and secluded grandeur.
