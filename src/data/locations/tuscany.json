  "heroDescription": "From sun-drenched vineyards to medieval hilltop towns and the dramatic Tyrrhenian coastline, Tuscany offers an unparalleled canvas for your Italian destination wedding.",
  "metaDescription": "Plan your dream destination wedding in Tuscany, Italy. Discover luxury wedding venues, historic villas, coastal retreats, and vineyard estates across Florence, Siena, and the Tuscan coast.",
  
  "about": {
    "intro": "Tuscany is the quintessential Italian wedding destination—a region where Renaissance art, rolling cypress-lined hills, and world-class wine estates converge to create an atmosphere of timeless elegance. Whether you envision an intimate ceremony in a medieval borgo, a grand celebration at a historic villa, or a seaside soirée on the Tyrrhenian coast, Tuscany delivers an unmatched blend of natural beauty, cultural richness, and culinary excellence.",
    "landscape": "The Tuscan landscape is iconic: golden wheat fields, ancient olive groves, prestigious vineyards stretching across gentle hills, and postcard-perfect hilltop towns like San Gimignano, Montepulciano, and Cortona. Along the coast, the Maremma and Monte Argentario offer dramatic cliffs, secluded coves, and luxury seaside resorts—a lesser-known but equally enchanting side of Tuscany.",
    "culture": "Tuscany is the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance. Florence alone is home to masterpieces by Michelangelo, Botticelli, and Leonardo da Vinci. But beyond the museums, Tuscany thrives on its living traditions: artisan winemakers, truffle hunters, master chefs, and generational craftspeople. For your wedding, this means access to world-class sommeliers, Michelin-starred catering, handmade linens, and florists who arrange with the same artistry as the Old Masters.",
    "cuisine": "Tuscan cuisine is rustic yet refined. Think wild boar ragu, hand-rolled pici pasta, bistecca alla Fiorentina, panzanella, and ribollita—paired with Brunello di Montalcino, Chianti Classico, or Vernaccia di San Gimignano. Wedding menus here celebrate farm-to-table philosophy with truffles, pecorino, olive oil pressed on-site, and seasonal produce from villa gardens."
