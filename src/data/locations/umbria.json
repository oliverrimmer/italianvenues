  "about": {
    "intro": "Umbria—often called 'Italy's green heart'—is a serene and enchanting region offering an authentic, unspoiled wedding destination. Tucked between Tuscany and Lazio, Umbria's rolling hills are dotted with medieval hilltop towns, ancient olive groves, and vineyards producing some of Italy's finest wines. This is a region where time slows down, where celebrations are truly immersive, and where hospitality feels deeply personal. A Umbria wedding promises intimacy, natural beauty, and a genuine connection to Italian rural life.",
    "landscape": "Umbria's landscape is characterized by gentle hills blanketed in olive groves and vineyards, punctuated by mystical medieval towns like Assisi, Perugia, Spoleto, and Orvieto. The dramatic Valnerina valley cuts through the region, offering stunning gorges and waterfalls. Lake Trasimeno, Italy's fourth-largest lake, provides serene waterfront wedding settings. From hilltop estates with panoramic views to rustic agriturismi nestled among olive trees, Umbria's venues blend seamlessly with the natural beauty that surrounds them.",
    "culture": "Umbria is the birthplace of saints and mystics—St. Francis of Assisi, St. Benedict, and many others found spiritual inspiration in this landscape. But beyond its religious heritage, Umbria thrives on its agricultural traditions, artisan crafts, and slow-living philosophy. The region is home to world-class ceramics from Deruta, hand-woven textiles from Norcia, and some of Italy's finest cured meats. Your wedding celebration here will be enriched by these authentic traditions, with local artisans often contributing to your event's decor and ambiance.",
    "cuisine": "Umbrian cuisine is simple yet sublime, focusing on premium local ingredients: black truffles from Norcia, lentils from Castelluccio, wild boar, porchetta, and pecorino cheeses. The region is also renowned for its wines—Sagrantino di Montefalco, Grechetto, and Orvieto DOC—perfect for toasting your marriage. Wedding menus here celebrate the harvest, with olive oil pressed on ancient estates and vegetables grown in kitchen gardens, creating meals that are both rustic and refined."

  "comparisonInsights": {
    "vsTuscany": "While Tuscany is famous and established, Umbria offers greater intimacy and authenticity. Venues are often more affordable, and the crowds are smaller. Umbria's hilltop towns and medieval character provide a distinctly different aesthetic from Tuscany's Renaissance grandeur.",
    "vsPuglia": "Puglia is coastal and expansive; Umbria is inland, intimate, and hilly. Puglia offers beach access and masserie life; Umbria delivers castle-topped hills and deep agricultural traditions. Both are authentic, but Umbria feels more secluded and mystical.",
    "vsLazio": "Umbria is Tuscany's quieter neighbor—more pastoral, less imperial. While Lazio is dominated by Rome's grandeur, Umbria offers peaceful countryside and medieval hill towns, ideal for couples seeking an escape from city energy.",
    "whyUmbria": "Umbria is Italy's best-kept secret for destination weddings. It offers Tuscany's charm without the crowds, stunning medieval architecture, world-class wine and cuisine, and venues that feel both historic and intimate. Perfect for couples seeking authenticity, tranquility, and natural beauty."
