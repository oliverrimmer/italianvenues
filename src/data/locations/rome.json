  "heroDescription": "From Vatican palaces to countryside villas, Rome and its surroundings offer the perfect blend of imperial grandeur, baroque splendor, and la dolce vita—the eternal city for timeless celebrations.",

  "about": {
    "intro": "Rome is the Eternal City—a living museum of 2,800 years of history where ancient ruins, baroque fountains, and Renaissance palaces create the most dramatic urban wedding backdrop on earth. Yet just beyond the Aurelian Walls, the Roman countryside (Castelli Romani, Frascati, and the Tyrrhenian coast) offers tranquil villas, vineyards, and seaside estates—combining imperial grandeur with Italian countryside charm.",
    "landscape": "Rome itself is a tapestry of iconic monuments—the Colosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Vatican—set among tree-lined cobblestone streets and piazzas. Within 30–60 minutes, the landscape transforms: hilltop towns of the Castelli Romani, Lake Bracciano's volcanic shores, Frascati's vine-covered hills, and coastal gems like Fregene and Santa Marinella. This diversity makes Rome ideal for multi-day celebrations blending city and country.",
    "culture": "Rome invented la dolce vita. The city's wedding culture is steeped in opera, haute couture, and Michelin-starred dining (more Michelin stars than any Italian city). Weddings here feel grand and cinematic—think Fellini, Audrey Hepburn on a Vespa, and sunset aperitivo on rooftop terraces overlooking the Pantheon. The region's artisan traditions include goldsmithing, marble sculpture, and bespoke tailoring.",
    "cuisine": "Roman cuisine is bold and rustic: carbonara, cacio e pepe, saltimbocca, artichokes alla giudia, and porchetta. Lazio wines—Frascati Superiore, Cesanese, Est! Est!! Est!!!—pair perfectly with wedding feasts. Many countryside villas feature farm-to-table dining with estate-grown produce, olive oil, and wine. City venues offer refined haute cuisine with views of illuminated monuments."
