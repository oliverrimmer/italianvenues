  "heroDescription": "From whitewashed trulli and baroque palazzos to dramatic clifftop towns and endless olive groves, Puglia offers an authentic, sun-drenched canvas for your Italian destination wedding.",
  "metaDescription": "Plan your dream destination wedding in Puglia, Italy. Discover luxury masserie, coastal venues, baroque palazzos, and trulli estates across the heel of Italy's Adriatic and Ionian coasts.",

  "about": {
    "intro": "Puglia—the heel of Italy's boot—is a revelation for couples seeking authenticity, natural beauty, and culinary excellence without the crowds of Tuscany or the Amalfi Coast. This sun-baked region stretches along 800 kilometers of Adriatic and Ionian coastline, where ancient olive groves meet crystal-clear waters, and UNESCO-protected trulli villages sit alongside baroque masterpieces. A Puglia wedding offers barefoot elegance, farm-to-table feasts, and venues that feel like secrets you've discovered yourself.",
    "landscape": "The landscape of Puglia is uniquely Mediterranean: endless silver-green olive groves (some trees over 2,000 years old), whitewashed towns perched on limestone cliffs, cone-shaped trulli houses dotting the Valle d'Itria, and dramatic coastal caves and coves carved by the Adriatic. From the chalk-white town of Ostuni to the turquoise waters of Polignano a Mare and the sandy beaches of Salento, Puglia's scenery is both raw and refined—perfect for couples who want natural beauty with character.",
    "culture": "Puglia's culture is deeply rooted in agriculture, fishing, and craftsmanship. Lecce is known as the 'Florence of the South' for its stunning Baroque architecture carved from local golden limestone. The region is also home to UNESCO World Heritage sites like the trulli of Alberobello and Castel del Monte. But what truly defines Puglia is its warm, unpretentious hospitality—locals celebrate life through food, wine, and communal gatherings, making it ideal for immersive, multi-day wedding celebrations.",
    "cuisine": "Puglian cuisine is honest, rustic, and unforgettable. Think handmade orecchiette with cime di rapa, burrata di Andria, octopus slow-cooked in terracotta pots, panzerotti, focaccia barese, and pasticciotto pastries. Paired with Primitivo di Manduria, Negroamaro, or crisp Verdeca whites, and finished with locally pressed extra virgin olive oil (Puglia produces 40% of Italy's olive oil), your wedding feast will be as memorable as the ceremony itself."

  "comparisonInsights": {
    "vsTuscany": "While Tuscany is iconic and well-established, Puglia offers a more unspoiled, authentic experience. Venues are often more affordable, with better value for money. Puglia's coastal access and unique architecture (trulli, masserie) set it apart from Tuscany's inland estates.",
    "vsAmalfiCoast": "The Amalfi Coast is dramatic and glamorous; Puglia is warm, rustic, and spacious. Puglia's masserie offer more privacy and exclusivity, with sprawling estates and lower density. The region is also more accessible and less crowded, making it ideal for multi-day celebrations.",
    "vsSicily": "Both are southern Italian gems, but Puglia is flatter, quieter, and more cohesive for travel. Sicily offers more dramatic volcanic landscapes and ancient ruins, while Puglia delivers olive groves, beaches, and a uniquely baroque-meets-rustic aesthetic.",
    "whyPuglia": "Puglia is Italy's best-kept secret for destination weddings. It offers Tuscan charm without the crowds, Amalfi beauty without the cliffs, and a culinary and cultural authenticity that feels refreshingly unpretentious. With world-class masserie, 800 km of coastline, and unbeatable hospitality, Puglia is perfect for couples seeking something special, soulful, and undiscovered."
