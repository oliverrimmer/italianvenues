  "about": {
    "intro": "The Amalfi Coast is Italy's most iconic seaside wedding destination—a UNESCO World Heritage Site where dramatic clifftop villages cascade down to the turquoise Mediterranean. With its pastel-hued architecture, terraced lemon groves, and panoramic coastal views, the Amalfi Coast delivers an unparalleled backdrop for a destination wedding that feels both intimate and cinematic.",
    "landscape": "The Costiera Amalfitana stretches 50 kilometers along the southern edge of the Sorrento Peninsula, featuring vertiginous cliffs, hidden coves, and picturesque towns like Positano, Ravello, Amalfi, and Praiano. Each village offers its own character: Positano for glamorous beachside elegance, Ravello for hilltop gardens and classical music, Amalfi for historic charm, and Sorrento for accessibility and vibrant culture.",
    "culture": "The Amalfi Coast has been a magnet for artists, writers, and jet-setters since the 1950s. Villa Cimbrone and Villa Rufolo in Ravello inspired Wagner and Greta Garbo. Today, the coast maintains its La Dolce Vita spirit with Michelin-starred restaurants, artisan ceramics, handmade limoncello, and centuries-old traditions like the Regata Storica. Weddings here blend Italian coastal sophistication with authentic southern warmth.",
    "cuisine": "Coastal cuisine reigns supreme: fresh seafood, handmade scialatielli pasta with seafood, buffalo mozzarella, San Marzano tomatoes, and of course, lemons—used in everything from limoncello to delizia al limone dessert. Weddings feature open-air terrace dining with views of the Bay of Salerno, paired with Campanian wines like Greco di Tufo and Falanghina."
