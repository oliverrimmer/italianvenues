  "about": {
    "intro": "Lake Como is Europe's most elegant and romantic wedding destination—a glacial lake surrounded by the Italian Alps, dotted with belle époque villas, terraced gardens, and charming villages. With its serene waters, dramatic mountain backdrop, and timeless Italian sophistication, Lake Como delivers an atmosphere of quiet luxury and old-world glamour unmatched anywhere else.",
    "landscape": "Shaped like an inverted 'Y', Lake Como stretches 46 kilometers through Lombardy, with three distinct branches. The western shore features grand villas and the city of Como; the eastern shore offers quieter charm in Varenna and Menaggio; and the central promontory of Bellagio—the 'Pearl of the Lake'—provides the most iconic views. Surrounding the lake are the pre-Alpine mountains, cypress-lined shores, and gardens filled with camellias, azaleas, and wisteria.",
    "culture": "Lake Como has been a retreat for European aristocracy, artists, and intellectuals since Roman times. Today it's beloved by Hollywood stars (George Clooney's Villa Oleandra is here) and fashion elite. The region celebrates elegance over ostentation: silk production in Como, artisan boat-building, classical music festivals, and Michelin-starred dining. Weddings here feel intimate, refined, and timelessly chic.",
    "cuisine": "Lombardian cuisine is rich and refined: risotto, polenta, missoltini (dried lake fish), ossobuco, and artisan cheeses. Lake Como weddings feature elegant terrace dining with views across the water, paired with Franciacorta sparkling wine and Valtellina reds. Many villas have historic kitchens and private chefs trained in both traditional and modern Italian cuisine."
