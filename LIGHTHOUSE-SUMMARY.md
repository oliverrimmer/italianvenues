## 🔧 Areas for Improvement

### ⚡ Performance (61/100) - Priority: HIGH

**Main Issues:**
1. **Largest Contentful Paint: 7.5s** (Target: < 2.5s)
   - Hero images are loading slowly
   - **Fix**: Optimize images, use WebP format, add lazy loading

2. **Unminified JavaScript: 1,397 KiB savings**
   - Dev server serves unminified code
   - **Fix**: ✅ Production build will fix this automatically

3. **Unused JavaScript: 71 KiB**
   - Some JS bundles contain unused code
   - **Fix**: Code splitting, tree shaking (already configured in Astro)

4. **Speed Index: 6.3s**
   - Page takes too long to become visually complete
   - **Fix**: Optimize images, defer non-critical JS

**Quick Wins for Performance:**
```bash
# 1. Add image optimization to Astro config
# 2. Use WebP/AVIF formats for hero images
# 3. Implement lazy loading for below-fold images
# 4. Consider CDN for image delivery (already using imagedelivery.net ✅)
```

### ✅ Best Practices (77/100) - Priority: MEDIUM

**Issues Detected:**
- Some console errors (likely from source maps in dev)
- Image aspect ratios could be more consistent
- Consider adding Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Recommendations:**
1. Add CSP headers for security
2. Ensure all images have consistent aspect ratios
3. Fix any console warnings

---

### ♿ Accessibility (94/100) - Priority: LOW

**Minor Issues:**
1. **Color Contrast** - Some text may need higher contrast
2. **Heading Order** - Ensure logical heading hierarchy

**Quick Fixes:**
```css
/* Ensure sufficient contrast ratios */
/* WCAG AA: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text */
```

## 🚀 Production vs Development

**Important Note:** Your dev server scores are LOWER than production will be because:
- ❌ Dev serves unminified JS (1.4 MB savings in prod)
- ❌ Dev has source maps enabled
- ❌ Dev has HMR (Hot Module Reload) overhead
- ❌ Dev doesn't use optimal caching

**Expected Production Scores:**
- Performance: **75-85/100** (vs 61 in dev)
- Best Practices: **85-95/100** (vs 77 in dev)
- Accessibility: **94/100** (unchanged)
- SEO: **92-100/100** (unchanged)
